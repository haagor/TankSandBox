# TankSandBox

## Initials motivations

This is my second Unity project. It's an occasion to start from scratch and alone for understand truly the basic of this framework. 

I want to make a small game with a tank. My main interest isn't to concentrate on the fight but on the travel. I want to gather a crew and one tank to face a harsh biome like desert. Move forward with the tank should be satisfying and to do that, I will jump on some physic simulation challenge

I find inspiration in Dune, Mad Max, Star Citizen, World of Tank, Hell let loose, Fury movie...

Hell let loose is my first experience with tank multiplayer. The crew is  composed by one chief, one pilot, one shooter. Their different view angle and mission in the tank provide a great teammate experience

## The adventure begin

I star with a simple terrain look like cubic desert and a nice small tank. I put some colliders, write a script to move the tank, add engine sound...

It's a cool start, but I want a better tank simulation. I discover then the WheelCollider. Next I explore the different strategies to simulate tank tracks. It's seem clear at this step that I have to focus on specifics things for learn and stop to rush a nice result. So I start to experiment the WheelCollider.

Next I follow this tutorial [https://habr.com/en/post/116088/] to deep dive to one simulate tank tracks strategy.
