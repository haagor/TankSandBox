# TankSandBox

This is my second Unity project. It's an occasion to start from scratch and alone for understand truly the basic of this framework. 

I want to make a small game with a tank. My main interest isn't to concentrate on the fight but on the travel. I want to gather a crew and one tank to face a harsh biome like desert. Move forward with the tank should be satisfying and to do that, I will jump on some physic simulation challenge

I find inspiration in Dune, Mad Max, Star Citizen, World of Tank, Hell let loose, Fury movie...

Hell let loose is my first experience with tank multiplayer. The crew is  composed by one chief, one pilot, one shooter. Their different view angle and mission in the tank provide a great teammate experience
